# NotGoodFizzBuzz

Welcome to the NotGoodFizzBuzz project! This is the FizzBuzz program you never knew you didn't need. It's complex, it's convoluted, and it's a testament to over-engineering at its finest.

## What is NotGoodFizzBuzz?

NotGoodFizzBuzz is a comically intricate implementation of the classic FizzBuzz problem. For those unfamiliar, FizzBuzz is a simple programming task often used in coding interviews. The task is straightforward:

- Print numbers from 1 to 100.
- For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number.
- For multiples of 5, print "Buzz".
- For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz".

But why solve a problem in a few lines of code when you can create an entire project out of it?

## Features

- **Over-Engineering**: We've taken a problem that can be solved in 5 lines of code and expanded it into a full-blown project with multiple files and directories.
- **Unnecessary Complexity**: Enjoy deciphering a codebase that's more complex than it needs to be. You'll find a Makefile, header files, and even a LICENSE because why not?
- **Educational Value**: Learn how not to write simple programs. Perfect for those who want to turn straightforward tasks into complicated endeavors.

## Installation

Because installing a simple FizzBuzz program should be as arduous as possible.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/NotGoodFizzBuzz.git
   cd NotGoodFizzBuzz
   ```

2. Build the project:
   ```sh
   make 
   ```

## Usage

Run the program and enjoy the overly complex output:

```sh
make run
```

## Contributing

Please don't. This project is already as needlessly complicated as it can get.

## License

This project is licensed under the MIT License because even jokes need legal protection.

## Why?

- Because we can.
- Because sometimes you just need to have a bit of fun with code.
- Because we wanted to see how far we could stretch a simple problem.

## The Joke

- **FizzBuzz is simple. This is not.**
- **If you think this is a serious project, you're missing the point.**
- **It's a testament to what happens when you have too much time on your hands.**
