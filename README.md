# NotGoodFizzBuzz

## TL;DR;
These are FizzBuzz programs that
use threads for no reason,   
separate files for no reason,   
create lots of classes for no reason,  
use lambda expressions for no reason,  
do not use smart pointers for no reason,   
and have meaningless naming.

## Usage
Made for mac OS. 
```
make
make run
```
